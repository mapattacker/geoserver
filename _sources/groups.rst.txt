Layer Groups
=============

To show multiple layers in a single map service, click ``Layer Group`` > ``Add New Layer Group``.

Now we can add the layers required and order them accordingly. 
Note that if you change the style of a particular layer, it will not be automatically reflected in the same layer in this layer group.
You will need to delete and add back the layer again.

    :figclass: align-center

.. note::
  Note that QGIS GeoServer Explorer plugin has an option to create layer groups but it has not allow ordering of the layers, which pretty much render it useless.
