Upload & Publish Layers
------------------------

Prepare the cartography in QGIS for each layer. Now drag the layer from the TOC to the GeoServer Explorer on the right and drop it
under ``layers``. Both the layer and style are uploaded to GeoServer. Note that the styling will add a default border though.
You will need to change this in GeoServer administration interface.

Now, choose the coordinate system, you can just search Singapore or other countries etc, and click on the appropriate CRS. 
Note that the option adding of styles to the layer is not working at this point of time.
