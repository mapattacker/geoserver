Upload & Publish Layers
------------------------

Prepare the cartography in QGIS for each layer. Now drag the layer from the TOC to the GeoServer Explorer on the right and drop it
under ``layers``. Both the layer and style are uploaded to GeoServer.

Now, choose the coordinate system, and also set the style to the one you just uploaded.
